[PUBLIC, EARLY VERSION] REST API, CSS3, JS, JQuery, PHP - HTML5 interface for Smartlaunch Captive Portal. 

Due to NDA, I can't share the finished masterpiece :( 

However, I have a public, technical demo of the finished skin while debugging (+active console) @ https://youtu.be/5MBqM-0LpdQ

For use for Smartlaunch (www.smartlaunch.com). Created with JS/JQ/PHP based on Ajax/Single-Page Application (SPA) techniques while utilizing a .NET RESTful API to communicate between client and server, all running on a 3MB local PHP server. The HTML5 interface above was running on a VB.NET form wrapping a Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) window.

Full integration with Smartlaunch Client, Server, and Administrator.

Also responsible for leading an Agile team, modifying this skin for use with ggCircuit ( www.ggcircuit.com ), now serving hundreds of thousands of players, daily.

This was further branched off to make a "Client Website" that utilized our API to pull stats and implement a generic login system that could be used as a template for their own website, if they used Smartlaunch.
